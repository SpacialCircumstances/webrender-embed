# webrender-embed

An example showing how to embed [webrender](https://github.com/servo/webrender) in an OpenGL application that uses [luminance](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs). 
The intention is to use luminance/OpenGL for drawing the scene and webrender for the GUI.

Mostly adapted from [the webrender examples](https://github.com/servo/webrender/tree/master/examples) and currently using a fork of luminance.
